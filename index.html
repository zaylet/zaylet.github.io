                    <td><p className="bioStyle">I moved to Pennsylvania from Puerto Rico two years ago hoping for a brighter future. I landed a job as a Warehouse Associate at Amazon and was promoted as an HR member, formerly known as PXT in Amazon within 1 year and 6 months.
                        I used to be self-conscious about my English when I moved to the United States. As a bilingual, I speak both English and Spanish. Within the first six months of starting at Amazon, I successfully facilitated communications between managers and associates
                        to help them overcome the language barrier. I do my best to assist associates, managers and peers on their job related duties in a timely manner. Though Spanish is my first language, it brings me great joy, as I advocate for English to second language
                        associates. I enjoy working in teams and guiding teammates overcome obstacles.
                        I have always had a natural curiosity and inclination towards coding. Not surprisingly, I grabbed the first opportunity I got to learn programming at We Can Code IT coding bootcamp through Amazon's Career Choice program. I am currently in the bootcamp
                        and will graduate in August 2022. My goal is to pivot my career and become a Software Developer. I am eager to work in this field and can't wait to network, learn and grow with some of the best and brightest minds as a first generation woman in tech in my family.</p></td>
