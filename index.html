            <p>My name is Zaylet Feliciano, I am 23 years old and I was born and raised in Puerto Rico. I moved to Pennsylvania two years ago 
                in the hopes to better my future. I started working in Amazon as a warehouse associate and in a year and 6 months I got a promotion
                to be the Communications Partner in a warehouse. I used to struggle with my English and was self-conscious with how I speak. Since 
                my promotion, I have been successfully helping associates that are in the same position I was in, breaking the language barrier between
                the associate and leadership. I was always interested in software developer but did not know where to start. Upon researching for schools
                through Amazon, I saw that there is a boot camp in We Can Code IT for Software Developer. Now I am currently studying on this bootcamp and will 
                graduate on August 2022.</p>
